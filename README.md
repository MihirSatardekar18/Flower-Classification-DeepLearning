# Flower Classification with Deep Learning ðŸŒ¸

This project demonstrates **Image Classification** of flowers using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** in **TensorFlow/Keras**.

## Features
- Train/Validation split with real-time dataset download
- CNN architecture with Dropout for overfitting control
- Accuracy & Loss visualization
- Sample predictions on validation set
- Real-time image upload and prediction

## Dataset
- Dataset used: [TensorFlow Flower Photos](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz)
- Classes: `daisy`, `dandelion`, `roses`, `sunflowers`, `tulips`

## How to Run
1. Open `Flower_Classification.ipynb` in **Google Colab**
2. Select **Runtime â†’ Change runtime type â†’ GPU**
3. Run all cells
4. Optional: Upload any flower image to see real-time predictions
